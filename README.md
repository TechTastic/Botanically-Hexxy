*A Botania x Hexcasting Interop Addon*

## To Do:
- **Cordyceps Cogitophaga**
    - This fungi-based plant is initially inert and produces mana when it is fed minds via ||Mind Flay||, which it will eventually consume, needing more minds to be fed to it
- **Botanist Impetus**
    - This impetus is triggered by mana burst and uses the provided mana for the resulting media wave
- Mana Spreaders targeting and depositing mana into Impeti (maybe special lens?)
- Media Rune as a new crafting item
- Mana Pools useable as media (maybe special version?)
